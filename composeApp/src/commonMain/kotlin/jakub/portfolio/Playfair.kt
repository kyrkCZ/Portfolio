/**
 * Playfair Cipher implementation.
 * 
 * The Playfair cipher is a manual symmetric encryption technique invented by Charles Wheatstone 
 * in 1854. It uses a 5×5 grid of letters as the encryption key and operates on digraphs (pairs 
 * of letters) instead of individual letters.
 * 
 * Note: The main implementation is currently in App.android.kt for Android-specific features.
 * This stub is reserved for a common multiplatform implementation.
 * 
 * TODO: Extract platform-agnostic Playfair logic to this common class
